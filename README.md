# Quick Sort
### Algorithm

1. Create result array list
2. if list input size is zero return result
3. middle is first element
4. middles are all in array that are same as middle
5. lessers are all less than middle
6. greaters are all greater than middle
7. Add all sort(lessers) to result
8. Add all sort(middles) to result
9. Add all sort(greaters) to result
10. return result
